<h1>PhysLights</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
We present a novel approach to CG lighting named <i>PhysLights</i>. <i>PhysLights</i> enables lighting artists to execute their vision and artistic choices in the physical space through a Tangible User Interface. This lighting is then represented in a conventional 3D package and rendered. Through <i>PhysLights</i> we explore the advantages and disadvantages of a Tangible User Interface in CG Lighting workflows, and the extent in which it can augment or replace traditional pipelines. <i>PhysLights</i> is part of our vision to make CG Animation production more approachable, more collaborative, and improve pre-existing pipelines.
</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<p>
Movement of physical spot lights will be captured by a Microsoft Kinect camera; The corresponding virtual lights will move in Maya, updating the interactive render.

<h2>Study</h2>
<p>
To evaluate the system and its usefulness, we wish to conduct a user study and interview with DreamWorks Animation employees with and without lighting expertise on Friday, 12/5/14 and, Monday 12/8/14. The experiment will take about 10 minutes per person, and requires a dark room. This is a more volunteers the merrier case, and we would be grateful if you could volunteer your time. Please contact me through <em>kyungyullim AT eng.ucsd.edu</em> for any questions. A pre-study questionnaire will be released soon.

Thanks!
